So far I have only passed to the frontend:
  - Ranges
  - Weapons
  - WeaponAccessories
  - Skills
  - Augmentations
  - Vehicles (including weapon mounts)
  - Gear
  - Armour
  - Qualities

Still need passed through to frontend):
  - ArmourAccessories
  - Spells
  - Drugs
  - DrugComponents
  - VehicleMods (including weapon mount mods)
  - Metatypes
  - Priorities

I need to parse, store in DB, and pass to frontend:
  - Powers

Other main priorities:
  - Complex Forms
  - Critter Powers
  - Critters
  - Echoes
  - Marital Arts
  - Mentors
  - Metamagic
  - Programs
  - Spirit Powers
  - Streams

Other xmls to maybe implement:
  - Actions
  - Contacts
  - Life modules
  - Lifestyles
  - Packs
  - Paragons
  - References
  - Settings
  - Traditions

Some xmls are better to just copy paste to an enum:
  - Licenses
