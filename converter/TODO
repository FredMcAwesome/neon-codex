Check all relationships match the docs (had some issues where onetoone aren't correct so aren't cascading)

So far I have only passed to the frontend:
  - Ranges
  - Weapons
  - Weapon Accessories
  - Skills
  - Augmentations
  - Vehicles (including weapon mounts)
  - Vehicle Mods (including weapon mount mods)
  - Gear
  - Armour
  - Armour Mods
  - Qualities
  - Metatypes
  - Priorities
  - Drugs
  - Spells
  - Complex Forms
  - Adept Powers
  - Programs
  - Traditions
  - Critters (Including spirits and sprites)
  - Mentors
  - Paragons
  - Marital Arts
  - Lifestyles

Still need passed through to frontend):
  - Drug Components
  - Critter Powers

Other main priorities:
  - Echoes
  - Metamagic

Other xmls to implement:
  - Actions
  - Life modules
  - Packs

Some xmls are better to just copy paste to an enum:
  - Licenses
  - Vessels
  - Contacts

Unused xmls (maybe referenced):
  - Books
  - Improvements
  - Options
  - References
  - Settings
  - Sheets
  - Spirit Powers (duplicated by critter powers)
  - Strings
  - Tips
